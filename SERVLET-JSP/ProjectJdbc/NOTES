The website needs to have the following features:
● A search form in the homepage to allow entry of travel details, like the date of travel, source, destination, and the number of persons.
● Based on the travel details entered, it will show the available flights with their ticket prices.
● Once a person selects a flight to book, they will be taken to a register page where they must fill in their personal details. 
In the next page, they are shown the flight details of the flight that they are booking, and the payment is done via a dummy 
payment gateway. 
On completion of the payment, they are shown a confirmation page with the details of the booking.
